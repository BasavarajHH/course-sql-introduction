### Types of Data

Data types for table columns are defined in the `schema`. How you develop you `schema` is up to you!

The most common data types are:

* `Text` (Names, Descriptions)
* `Numeric` (Cost, Age, Weight, Quantity)
* `Dates` (Dates and Time)

#### Notes

Its important to have the correct data type for your data. This ensures that sorting and calculations work properly.
