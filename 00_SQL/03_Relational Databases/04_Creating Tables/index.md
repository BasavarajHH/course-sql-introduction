### How to Create Tables
#### Now let's take a look into how to create a table ourselves!

The `create table` statement is used to create a new table. This is the format to create and simple table using SQL:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "tablename"
("column1" "data type",
 "column2" "data type",
 "column3" "data type");
```

This would be the format of create table command if you were to use optional constraints:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "tablename"
 ("column1" "data type"
         [constraint],
  "column2" "data type"
         [constraint],
  "column3" "data type"
        [constraint]);
```

Note: You may have as many columns as you'd like, and the constraints are optional.

Also friendly reminder... all SQL statements end with a semi-colon `;`

Now lets try to create a table on your own!
