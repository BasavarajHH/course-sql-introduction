### How to Create Tables
#### Now let's take a look into how to create a table ourselves!

The `create table` statement is used to create a new table. This is the format to create and simple table using SQL:

Now using the same browser from W3 schools located [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all), enter the following command to create your own table.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers;
```

Note: You may have as many columns as you'd like, and the constraints are optional.
