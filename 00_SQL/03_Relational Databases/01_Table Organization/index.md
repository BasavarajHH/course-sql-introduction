### Table Organization
#### Let's see how tables are organized.

Usually separate tables contain data for a specific type of thing.

Each table can have relationships with each other, instead of repeating the same product how ever many times someone buys it, we can instead reference back to that product in a separate table.

Again, don't worry if this is a bit confusing! It will make more sense as we go!

The same database can be used in different ways across applications at the same time.


#### Example
~ An app could be pulling data to show the average time a product is being used.
~ An analyst could be pulling the data to learn what product has the most sales.
