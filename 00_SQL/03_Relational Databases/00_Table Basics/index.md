### What is a Relational Database?

#### There are two major components in a database:

* `Data` (Information Stored) and `Schema` (How the data is organized)

* `Sections`, also called tables. This is how the data is structured.

##### You can think of tables like how we arrange information in an excel spreadsheet!


`Rows` go horizontal and `Columns` go vertical.
