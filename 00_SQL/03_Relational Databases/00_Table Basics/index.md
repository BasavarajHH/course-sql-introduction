### What is a Relational Database?
#### There are two major components in a database:

~ Data (Information Stored) and Schema (How the data is organized)

~ Sections, Also called tables. This is how the data is structured.

You can think of tables like an excel spreadsheet!

`Rows` go horizontal and `Columns` go vertical.
