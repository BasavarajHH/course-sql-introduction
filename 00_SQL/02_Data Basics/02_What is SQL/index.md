#### Seeeequel

SQL (pronounced "see-que-el" or 'S' 'Q' 'L') Either way is perfectly the same! SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

This is the language and syntax we will use to interact with SQL databases. When we return and search data from a database we call it Querying.


Common SQL Databases:

Each of these databases can be Queried using the SQL programming Language.

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Microsoft SQL
SQLite
Oracle

Note: There are some slight differences to each database, but most of the SQL commands we're going to cover will be the same or very similar.
