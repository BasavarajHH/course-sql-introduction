### Congratulations, you've just completed the Intro to SQL course!

What all have we learned so far..

#### Data Basics
We learned that data is information. Anything that can be used for interpreting information can be considered data and where that is stored is our `database`.

#### Relational databases
Relational databases are structured to recognize where items of information are related to one another.

#### Selecting Data

```SQL
 SELECT * FROM "Value";
```
##### Creating a Table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "tablename"
("column1" "data type",
 "column2" "data type",
 "column3" "data type");
```
