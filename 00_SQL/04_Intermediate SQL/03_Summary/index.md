### Summary
#### Congratulations, you've just completed the Intro to SQl course!

What all have we learned so far..

##### Data Basics
We learned that data is information. Anything that can be used for interpreting information can be considered data and where that is stored is our `database`.

##### Relational databases
Relational databases are structured to recognize where items of information are related to one another.

##### Selecting Data
```
select "column1"
 [,"column2" ,etc]
 from "tablename"
 [where "condition"];
 [] = optional
```
##### Creating a Table
```
create table "tablename"
("column1" "data type",
 "column2" "data type",
 "column3" "data type");
```
